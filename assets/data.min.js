    about: { "tech-stats": "Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science and AI Enthusiast", bio: "For all we know, this bio could be from Chat-GPT! As such, my research focuses on the appliction of AI in social media and how it can be used to help reduce polarisation, as well as analysing the risks of social chatbots manipulating online discourse to undermine our democratic institutions. My inter-disciplinary experience spans computer science, cyber-security, and international relations - I love to bring policy and practitioners together.<br>I am always interested in collaborating in areas including cyber-security, social media, technology policy and cyber-regulation, government and private-sector analysis and research. In my free time, I love music (jpop/jrock to euro-metal), nature and VR/strategy games.<br>My supervisors are: <a href=\"https://www.jorgegoncalves.com\">A/Prof Jorge Goncalves</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eduardovelloso.com/\">Prof. Eduardo Velloso</a>, <a href=\"https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/799877-vassilis-kostakos\">Prof. Vassilis Kostakos</a>", "IDE, Editors & Tools": ["AWS", "PyTorch", "TensorFlow", "Python (my favourite language!)", "Java", "C/C++/C#", "SQL (Oracle/MongoDB/SQLServer)", "R", "Penetration Testing", "Malware Analysis (Reverse Engineering)", "Scala", "CUDA", "Networking (CISCO CCNA)"] },
